In this one i am going to write about what i am thinking whilst doing the code.

Here is the basic plan i have created a login interface so what i thought is maybe we can create like a profile for this blockchain one cause it can manage a database of info too.

First i am going to make a program called duck.c for helping me during the code.

Just completed creating the duck.c for helping write my blog easily.

Here when i will start linking nodes togther i need a previous and next node for each node but if the node is the first node or if its the last node for that what i will do is assign a default value to each node and change it if there are any previous node and next node but leave it if there isnt one.

Created a new datatype so that i can store relevant and neccessary information together, now i am going to try to bring hashing into the scene for that i will create another file to first test out and implement it there and then use that experience here, all of it progress will be on a different branch.

so i am back after 2 days of school, first let me re-understtand what i did and what i have to do now.

The transaction data type will hold now hold more information: the source and destination of the payment

Okay so i am back but i have something very cool with me, it is GitHub CoPilot.
I am really excited to start again on my project, had some issues in between and didnt really do anything but from now on i will try to be more consistent.

Now i have studied and tried different things and have decide what to do next so first let me merge my login interface into this thing and then i think i will start ahead.

Now i have configured my old project and now i will first import it into the new project, the projects have also been updated to match their purpose more.

Finally finally made the hashing function work will do the needfull to secure the database and user data with the hashing function.

Me to Duck 29/11/2021 17:13
Successfully made the hash work perfectly now no one can see what is the actual data, i might still do some more tinkering to find some loopholes in the code but for now just to save the progress i will commit these changes.

I tested my code with valgrind to check memory leaks and found a few leaks, i have tried to fix them, most of them did but i couldnt fix this one memory leak, because i need to return that variable and i cannot free it without returning and once i return nothing can be freed, i will try to find if something cann be done for this.
